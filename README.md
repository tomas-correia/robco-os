# RobCo Terminal

This project aims to recreate a [terminal](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Terminal) from [Fallout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)) in your computer's terminal.

## How to run

1. Install dependencies using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/);
1. Run `py main.py` in the project's root directory.

I'll release the program in an executable format later on.
